# Ng2PowerTable

Ng2PowerTable is table module for Angular 2. It is designed to be modular and easily customizable. Other table modules require Controllers to provide information for which columns are visible and even providing their respective templates. I believe the view, and the view only, should be responsible for how the table is rendered.

If you've used [Smart Table](https://github.com/lorenzofox3/Smart-Table) for Angular 1.x, you'll find some similarities to Ng2PowerTable.

# Installation

## 1. Install Ng2PowerTable

using Node Package Manager:

`npm install ng2-power-table`

## 2. Modify SystemJS bootloader to load Ng2PowerTable ([see documentation](https://ng2-power-table.hoveytech.com))

```javascript
(function (global) {
    var config = {
        map: {
            'ng2-power-table': 'node_modules/ng2-power-table',
        },
        packages: {
            "ng2-power-table": { main: "index.js", defaultExtension: "js" },
        }
    };
    System.config(config);
})(this);
```

# Usage

### 1. Add `ptTable` attribute to any element using for table, i.e. `<table [ptTable]="allCustomers">...`

`ptTable` is 'parent' directive and is required by other directives/components. Include one-way binding for `ptTable` which should be the original array of items for table (i.e. un-sorted, un-paged).

### 2. Add `ptDisplayArray` attribute on same element as `ptTable` with two-way binding.

`ptDisplayArray` is the resulting array after Ng2PowerTable has processed the original array of items. For example on a table `...<table [ptTable]="allCustomers" [(ptDisplayArray)]="displayCustomers">...`

Now you can use `*ngFor` over a `tr` element (or whatever you want) and repeat over the resulting `displayCustomers` of example.

Internally Ng2PowerTable uses a service `DefaultDataPipeService` that does client-side paging and sorting. The output of this service is set to your binding of `ptDisplayArray`. FYI: A different `IDataPipeService` could be configured that does server-side paging/sorting/filtering.

### 3. Add any sorting to header elements.

Use `ptSort` attribute with value set to property name for sorting. For example on a table header `...<th ptSort="name">Name</th>...`.

### 4. Add pagination 

Add element `<pt-pagination></pt-pagination>` somewhere within `ptTable` element. This component renders navigation buttons to move thru pages of resulting data.

Example template:

```javascript
<table [ptTable]="allCustomers" [(ptDisplayArray)]="displayCustomers">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th ptSort="id">Id<th>
            <th ptSort="name">Name<th>
            <th>Open Invoices<th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr ngFor="#c of displayCustomers">
            <td>{{c.id}}</td>
            <td>{{c.name}}</td>
            <td>{{c.invoices}}</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
    <tfoot>
        <pt-pagination></pt-pagination>
    </tfoot>
</table>
```
